A live stream plugin that can be embedded on external websites

In order to use the plugin:
1. Add references to jQuery and the plugin script  to your webpage. 
e.g. <head>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="http://members.icradio.com/plugins/player/plugin.js"></script>
</head>

2. Add the following code to the area of the website where the player will reside:
<div id="icradio-live-plugin"></div>

3. If you would like to customise the player create custom css based on the /plugin.css fle.

Enjoy!
